extend functionalities preNFB
- ROI shapes
	- functional clusters
	- spherical (not simply Roi on center point and include spherical neighbours within radius X around but:
	   mask out, using func cluster, then...)
	- Drop a pin and get sphere

Sess to Sess coregistration
- coregister between structurals 
- coregsiter high quality EPI (TR 4 seconds)
	- this requires a intermediate coregistration step on day 1 --> why?
		first HQ EPI (TR 4 sec x8 vols = 30 sec)
- perform corrections (check for NaNs etc)


OpenNFT inegration
- have it run on matlabhelper 4 - GUI data estimation
- after initialization (launch button next to initialization)
- potentially use the orthview function from OpenNFT (when updated!) 

computational project
- problem with incremental GLM (see real-time fmri processing with physiological noise correction, Masaya Misaki, 2015)
- start looking into how incremental GLM is perfromed in OpenNFT and start playing with some offline data)

- problem: initial overfitting of the data
- solution: use a number of volumes acquired prior to NFB onset to correct for overfitting)

- the solution of to the problem could be integrated with the preNFB tool (button performing this correction i.e. loading the covariance matrices0
